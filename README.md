## Projects
[**Data Wizardry Health Care System Flu Shots Dashboard 2022**](https://github.com/jordanbaluyot/jordanbaluyot.github.io/blob/main/SQL%20Flu%20Shots%20Data%20Organization.sql)
[**Flu Shots Data Analysis 2022**](https://github.com/jordanbaluyot/jordanbaluyot.github.io/blob/main/SQL%20Flu%20Shots%20Data%20Organization.sql)
- In this project, I analyzed 2022 flu vaccination data to determine total vaccination rates and patterns among active patients. Using SQL, I segmented flu shot recipients by age, race, and county, calculated a running total over the year, and identified individual vaccination statuses to inform public health strategies
- In the Dashboard, I visualize 2022 flu vaccination data to reveal compliance rates and trends across different demographics, supporting targeted public health interventions.
- Key Insights: The dashboard highlights vaccination patterns by age, race, and county, and displays overall compliance rates and total shots given, identifying gaps in coverage.
- Visual Components: Includes segmented bar charts by age and race, a map showing county compliance, an individual patient list, and a running total of flu shots over time, using a dark background with teal accents for clarity.

[**Reddit Data Extraction and Analysis**](https://github.com/jordanbaluyot/portfolio/blob/main/PRAW%20Integration%20Task.py)
- In this project, I analyzed community interactions and perceptions of cities across 2,000+ location-based subreddits by extracting subreddit descriptions using Python and the Reddit API, organizing the data into an Excel sheet for further analysis.

[**Data Cleaning In MySQL**](https://github.com/jordanbaluyot/jordanbaluyot.github.io/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20in%20MySQL.sql)
- In this project I took raw layoffs data and transform it in **SQL** server to make it usable for analysis.

[**Exploratory Data Analysis**](https://github.com/jordanbaluyot/jordanbaluyot.github.io/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.sql)
- In this project I conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL on a dataset detailing company layoffs. I performed various queries to explore trends, outliers, and insights related to layoffs over time, across countries, companies, and different funding stages.
